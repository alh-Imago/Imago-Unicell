# Hex-N: direction scoping (v1, 5 Nov 2026)

A living note. It records where the work is heading, what is core and what is a side route, and how far the build is from the core idea. It may grow or shrink. Tags: [file] read in a file, [card] seen on the Kintex card, [sim] simulation only, [open] undecided or unchecked, [Alan] said by Alan.

## 1. The core idea
From `HEXN_DESIGN.md` sections 1 to 3 [file]: Hex-N is the silicon version of a nerve cell and then a substrate of many. A cell has six faces with lanes, adds up what arrives, compares the total with a threshold and fires a graded burst. Its programme is a pattern that is trained, not written. Learning has three steps: train in the VM, freeze the pattern, optionally keep mutating in silicon.

## 2. Core line and side route [Alan, 5 Nov 22:53]
- **Core line:** the layer 1 counted detector, the layers above it (the helper / neural judge, the choice engine), the batch judge beside them, and the learning. The detector and the batch judge fit this schema well; the layer 1 detector was part of the initial thrust.
- **Side route:** the hex work cells were applied early, to see whether they could interface with the schema and use the space on the Kintex card. They are extra processing capacity (the pattern arrays), not the neuron.
- **Direction:** the original schema, with the Kintex space as the extra processing array.

## 3. Where the build stands against it
| Part | State |
|---|---|
| Layer 1 counted detector | Built and run on the Tang Nano 20K [file: ledger Oct 2026]. Not in the current Kintex base [Alan confirmed 19:49]. Earlier Kintex builds ran it with the memory tier. |
| Layers 2 to 4 (combined) | Not in the Kintex base [open: ledger says they were combined and later removed; not re-checked]. |
| Neural judge (helper) | `rtl/hexn_neural_v1.v`, simulated only, in no top level [sim]. |
| Batch judge | Built (Tang batch scorer); runs on the Kintex base [card]. Weights are worked out on the host, not learned on chip. Weight store with save, load and a cross-index to program slots: simulation only [sim]. |
| Pattern arrays (hex7, hex6) | On the Kintex card with a JTAG controller, results RAM with stop-and-flag, data RAM with run-from-RAM [card]. Six work types in use. |
| Merged work cell | `hexn_tile_wk_v1.v`, equal to the six old tiles in simulation; synthesis size only (about 656 LUT); not in the generator or any build [sim]. |
| Auto picker (data in, judge picks the program, data runs through it) | Agreed as the next build; slot choice by the judge works on the card, the sequencer is not built [card / open]. |
| Learning in silicon (step 3) | Not done. |

## 4. Gaps to the core idea
1. The detector and the upper layers are not on the Kintex base; there is no direct input path to the card other than JTAG, so raw data would not reach it anyway [Alan].
2. Learning is on the host: batch weights are computed there; nothing mutates on chip.
3. The neural judge has no home: inputs, teacher and role are undecided.
4. The work cells are serial word cores, not the summing cell of section 1.

## 5. Open decisions
- Faces of the neuron cell do not talk to each other (`HEXN_DESIGN.md` 2a): decision for Alan, not seen settled.
- Leak or clear, memory size, where the teacher lives (design doc section 5).
- Where the pattern arrays sit in the layers: after the helper and before the choice engine (a), after the choice engine (b), or extra processing after layer 1 (c). The base behaves as (c).
- Auto picker: how many programs; what happens when no result or an empty slot.
- Merged work cell: every core in every cell (as built) or a chosen subset; add SQ and LT or not.
- Work cell shape: the neuron-style cell versus the word cores for the arrays.

## 6. Next steps (proposals, not commitments)
1. Merged cell into the pattern generator; place and route it on the Kintex flow for real size and clock.
2. Auto picker sequencer (ctl v5) on the existing judge, weight store and data RAM.
3. Decide the neural judge's placement and what gets brought back onto the Kintex from layer 1 upward.

## 7. Note on the design document
The status line of `HEXN_DESIGN.md` (20 Oct: "nothing has been routed or run on a card") is out of date. The ledger is append-only, so it is corrected here and by a ledger row, not by editing it.

## 8. Weight library and the self-teaching loop (Alan, 7 Nov 21:33 to 21:39; IDEAS, nothing built)
- **Idea [Alan]:** as data arrives the judge loads a program and its weights. If no stored weight set fits, it searches the stored sets with a fuzzy match, loads the pre-completed ones, compares them, finds what they have in common and builds the new set from that (the stored things are weight sets, not paths).
- **Teacher placement [Alan]:** if a prediction from matching against the cross map turns out correct, that result feeds back into the system. Whether this sits in teacher mode or live mode is a real question. Prediction against the next observation gives labels for free (reality is the answer), which is the reward step of the Gemini list (`HEXN_GEMINI_SCOPING_NOTES_v1.md`, step 5) and the open question in `LAYER_INTERFACES_v4.md` (does layer 2's verdict teach layer 1).
- **What fits the base today [file]:** numbered weight sets saved from and loaded into the judge, a cross-index tying a set to a program slot (simulation only), the detector core's save-and-recall block with a best and second-best match (ran on the card in Oct), layer 2 history store (Tang), layer 3 (Python model only).
- **Proposed placement (Claude's proposal, untested):** teacher mode with known answers sets the baselines and is the only way sets enter the saved library; live mode adjusts a working copy only, in small bounded steps; a working copy is promoted to a saved set only after enough confirmed hits, the old set kept. Reason: a system that trusts its own correct guesses without limit can lock in a wrong habit. Learning stays on the host (training is hosted anyway); the card judges.
- **"Fit" measure [open]:** with a teacher, agreement of the judge's decisions with the right answers; without one, only a weak proxy such as the gap between the two class scores. "Common weights" is meaningful only between sets of the same layout (same sensors, same class meanings).

## 9. The question that follows: scale (Alan, 7 Nov 21:39; to be taken up once the model above is more settled)
Can it be scaled, and if so how and where? Not answered here. Figures already in the files, to start from (all as recorded, none re-measured today): about 450 LUT per extra detector and about 10,100 LUT for hex19 with one cell, 128 cells placed at 73 MHz (nextpnr estimate, not run on the card) [file, Oct]; eight parallel banks about 68,000 LUT by arithmetic against 298,600 on the chip [arith, 5 Nov]; the JTAG bridge about 5,500 scans per second, per-scan cost dominating, the card's PCIe link dead [card, 5 Nov and Oct]; the weight store 512 words per set in a 2,048-word block RAM [file]. Questions to settle then: what scales (detectors, sensors, stored sets, programs), where the limit sits (logic, memory, the JTAG link, the host), and whether it scales inside one card, across cards, or in the host.
