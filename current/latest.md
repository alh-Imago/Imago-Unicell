# Current State (as of 2026-08-16, later same day -- a new session picked up after a usage reset; see `points.md` #343 for what got added, `archeology/sessions/archive-2026-08-16.md`'s own "PART 2" section for the fuller #336-342 narrative)

## Read this first

Everything through `#355` (documented below) was built earlier this
session. Alan said "lets continue we have usage at this time, so lets
see if this can get done in that." Item 1's own follow-on -- items 2/4
of `#216` (grid construction + cell-design-aware) turned out to be the
SAME real undertaking once scoped: `nano/generic_field_codec_v1.py`, a
field pack/unpack engine driven entirely by `root_definition.json`,
never consulting `icm_v3.py`'s own hand-typed tables. Proven bit-for-
bit equivalent to `icm_v3.py`'s already-RTL-verified codec across all 6
cores and many values -- not assumed from matching source data, checked
systematically. 8 new tests, 163/163 across the full new-work suite,
zero regression on the legacy 64+6 nano scripts. Pushed to `origin/main`.

## What's real and built

- **`nano/icm_v3.py`** -- `SUPER_LATCH[79:0]` encode/decode, verified
  bit-for-bit against `tb_unicell_super_v1.v`'s own real RTL test
  vectors (iverilog installed fresh this session, wasn't there
  before).
- **`nano/unicell_super_automaton_v1.py`** -- `SuperCell`/`SuperGrid`,
  dispatching across all 6 core types. nano delegated to the existing,
  already-proven `CACell` (composition, not reinvention); the other 5
  cores' behavior transcribed from their own real RTL bodies.
- **`nano/super_tile_library_v1.py`** -- Tier 0, six single-cell
  primitives with named ports, plus target tagging
  (`TARGET_UNICELL_N`/`TARGET_UNICELL_S`, `"universal"`/`"super-only"`)
  and a real second placement backend (`place_on_nano()`) proving
  "universal" is a functional guarantee, not a label.
- **`nano/composed_tile_library_v1.py`** -- Tier 1, `place_composed()`.
  Three tiles: `sentinel` (verified against the exact proven hardware
  behavior sequence), `dual_threshold_monitor` (fan-out + non-linear
  placement), `twin_sentinel` (nested composition -- a composed tile
  built from OTHER composed tiles, proven with double-namespaced
  params resolving correctly at arbitrary depth).
- **`docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/super_tile_library_scope.md`** --
  the Tier-0/Tier-1 scoping note, written before any of the above was
  built.
- **`docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/unicell_s_dsl_and_compiler_scope.md`**
  -- the DSL/compiler design proposal. Alan's own real choices so far:
  a fresh purpose-built DSL (not a Python-AST subset), diagnostics
  that are first-class (what/problem/why/suggestion, not bare
  exceptions), and a multi-pass architecture where passes collect
  every problem in one go rather than stopping at the first --
  `cell_format.py`'s own `check_pipeline_bridges()` is the real,
  already-built precedent for that shape. Nested composition
  (originally an open question in this note) is now CONFIRMED and
  PROVEN (`#342`).
- **`nano/dsl_diagnostics_v1.py`/`dsl_lexer_v1.py`/`dsl_parser_v1.py`/
  `dsl_compiler_v1.py`** -- the DSL's first real slice (`#343`). A
  `program { place ... }` grammar compiles end to end for both Tier-0
  and Tier-1 tiles (including fan-out lists and nested/namespaced
  params), with real `CompileDiagnostic`s (what/problem/why/suggestion
  + a real source span) rather than bare exceptions. RESOLVE/PLACE
  reuse `place()`/`place_composed()`'s own existing validation
  directly. "Collect every problem, don't stop at the first" confirmed
  directly for resolve/place-stage errors; lex/parse error recovery is
  the one honest, stated limitation (stops at the first syntax error).
- **`nano/program_ir_v1.py`** -- the shared, frontend-agnostic IR
  (`#344`), pulled directly out of the DSL parser's own node shapes
  (not redesigned speculatively). `dsl_compiler_v1.compile_program_ir()`
  is the real backend now; `compile_source()` is the DSL's own thin
  wrapper on top of it.
- **`nano/python_frontend_v1.py`** -- a second, real, working frontend
  proving the IR/backend split actually works, not just asserting it.
  Builds `ProgramIR` from plain Python dicts, never touches the DSL
  lexer/parser at all, and produces byte-identical output to the DSL
  frontend for the same program (`test_dsl_and_dict_frontends_agree_
  on_the_same_program`).
- **`nano/user_tile_loader_v1.py` / `nano/dsl_cli_v1.py`** -- "use this
  model" (`#345`). A real, working command-line tool: `python3
  dsl_cli_v1.py program.uc --model my_tile.json -o out.icm`. The JSON
  model format is a direct mirror of `ComposedTileSpec`, not a new
  format -- so a future composer export just needs to produce this same
  shape. `ComposedTileLibrary` gained optional parent-chaining so a
  user model shadows a same-named built-in without ever mutating the
  real registry -- tested both directions (shadowing confirmed,
  unrelated built-ins still resolve correctly alongside a loaded user
  model). Tested as a real command via `subprocess.run()`, not just
  Python internals called in-process.
- **`define`/`expose` grammar (`#346`, internals finished `#347`).** A
  program can define its own reusable composed tile inline: `define
  NAME { place ... expose ... }`, then `place` it exactly like any
  built-in tile. Fixed sub-cell params (`SubCellPlacement.fixed_params`)
  and forward declarations (two-pass: all defines first, in their own
  order, then all places) both real and tested -- a `define` still
  can't forward-reference a LATER `define`, a real, narrower, stated
  limit.
- **`nano/python_ast_frontend_v1.py`** -- a real Python-AST frontend
  (`#348`), genuinely distinct from `#344`'s dict-based proof-of-concept:
  parses actual Python syntax (`ast.parse()`, never `exec()`s it) --
  `place(...)` calls and `with define("name"): ...` blocks, every
  argument a plain literal. Cross-checked against the DSL frontend for
  the same program, byte-identical output. Every `#347` mechanism
  (define/expose/fixed-params) inherited for free, confirmed not
  assumed, since this frontend produces the same `ProgramIR` shape.
- **`docs/stripped-cell/UNICELL_S_DSL_MANUAL.md`** (`#349`, corrected
  `#350`) -- the language reference. Every code example independently
  compiled and confirmed working before inclusion. `#350` fixed a real
  framing error: "no automatic placement" was listed as a compiler
  limitation, but this project already settled that exact architectural
  boundary for the old full-cell system (`model -> ICM (shape-neutral)
  -> [BINDER] -> placement -> loader -> silicon`) -- corrected to state
  it as a genuine boundary (§9), not a gap the compiler should fill.
- **Naming hygiene lint + circular-reference guard (`#350`)** --
  `_lint_names()` (`dsl_compiler_v1.py`): real `severity: "warning"`
  diagnostics for duplicate local names, collected, shown, never
  blocking compilation. A REAL circular-reference bug found and fixed
  in `place_composed()` (`composed_tile_library_v1.py`) -- a
  hand-crafted `--model` JSON tile could self-reference or cycle
  indirectly with zero protection; confirmed as a genuine
  `RecursionError` before being fixed, not assumed. Now a clear
  `ValueError` naming the exact cycle chain.
- **The long-range note (`#351`/`#352`/`#353`)** --
  `docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/general_purpose_programming_
  long_range_note.md`. Captured, not started: real general-purpose
  programming on Unicell-S; "the FPGA design side route" clarified
  (lowering the compiler's own output past ICM v3 to real synthesizable
  Verilog, a natural backend-side extension of the already-proven "many
  frontends, one shared IR"); "LEGO for FPGA," which turned out to be
  the direct fulfillment of a real requirement Alan already stated the
  day before this session began (`#317`) -- the RTL's own `core_select`
  field already reserves the headroom for it.
- **`nano/vm_introspection_v1.py`** (`#354`) -- JSON introspection for
  the real VM, the first piece of `#216`'s own VM-core architecture,
  per Alan's own chosen sequencing (VM-core work before the workbench
  itself). Verified against actual running VM state -- the proven
  `sentinel` sequence, including its real sticky-latch behavior still
  correctly visible through the introspection layer once the
  accumulator drops back below threshold.
- **`nano/root_definition_extractor_v1.py` / `validate_icm_v3_
  against_rtl_v1.py` / `regenerate_root_definition_v1.py`** (`#355`) --
  `#216` item 1. Mechanically extracts field-map bit positions directly
  from the RTL's own comments -- confirmed genuinely tractable before
  building, not assumed. Two real parser bugs found and fixed against
  actual RTL during development (wrapped headers/descriptions silently
  losing fields), locked in as regression tests. The real payoff: an
  independent cross-check against `icm_v3.py`'s own hand-typed field
  tables (built by a human this session, transcribing the same RTL
  comments) -- PASSED, zero mismatches, genuine positive confirmation
  the earlier transcription was accurate. `nano/root_definition.json`
  is the real, re-runnable persisted artifact. Honest gap:
  `addon_config`'s own fields aren't covered (wired via module ports,
  not the same comment convention).
- **`nano/generic_field_codec_v1.py`** (`#356`) -- `#216` items 2/4,
  which turned out to be the same undertaking once scoped. Field pack/
  unpack driven entirely by `root_definition.json`, never consulting
  `icm_v3.py`'s own hand-typed tables. Proven bit-for-bit equivalent to
  `icm_v3.py`'s already-RTL-verified codec across all 6 cores and many
  values, checked systematically not assumed. Real, honest scope
  boundary: `addon_config` still isn't covered; the direction-name/list
  convenience deliberately isn't re-derived here (a separate,
  reusable-as-is concern). The actual grid/cell construction layer
  using this codec is still unstarted -- this is the field-level
  foundation only.

## What's NOT built yet -- open, real options

Per `#349`/`#350`'s own remaining "known limitations": parser error
recovery (one syntax error stops compilation, not a full list);
`define` can't forward-reference a LATER `define`; no multiple programs
per file (DSL or Python frontend). C/Rust frontends need an external
parser library first, not attempted. A REAL loader/binder stage for
Unicell-S is genuinely new, unscoped work now that `#350` corrected the
manual's framing -- the compiler deliberately does NOT do real hardware
placement, and nothing yet does. `#216`'s remaining VM-core items, in
its own order -- item 3 (dual CPU/GPU execution, next), item 6
(AI-interaction port), item 8 (the `core/` folder name) -- are real and
unstarted. The actual generic grid/cell construction layer (a
`SuperCell` built from `root_definition.json` rather than hand-coded
per-core Python classes) also remains unstarted -- items 1/2/4 provided
the field-level foundation, not the full engine. The workbench itself
hasn't been started -- Alan's own explicit choice to do `#216`'s
foundation work first. The composer (Stage 5, `#20`) remains explicitly
later work, after both compiler and workbench.

## Also still open (carried forward, unchanged from this morning)

- `hardware/Arria10_Programming_Procedure.md` -- needs Alan's own
  judgment call (archive vs. refresh).
- The `mathtrix` root/community structural question.
- The super carrier shell's own remaining gaps (`latch_in`/
  `latch_A_dis` absent from every core; the `#323` register-count
  discrepancy; a real host/JTAG-wrapped version of the super cell).
- The RAM-side address-arbitration/retry-loop mechanism (`#301`/`#302`)
  -- needs real testing before trust.
- `sentinel_counter_v1.v`/`v2.v` still not wired into any real chain;
  `shared_bram_arbiter_v1.v` still not wired into the full tree
  system.
- The two long-queued Quartus diagnostic experiments (duplication
  flags, aggressive optimization mode).
- The 77-file root Python sprawl -- still deliberately held until the
  real VM/`core/` rebuild (now genuinely underway) is far enough along
  that archival is a real replacement, not speculative deletion.

## Next session

Continue `#216`'s items in order -- item 3 (dual CPU/GPU execution) is
next. Real scope note: the actual generic grid/cell construction layer
(a `SuperCell` built from `root_definition.json`/`generic_field_codec_
v1.py` rather than hand-coded per-core Python classes) is still real,
unstarted work -- items 1/2/4 provided the field-level foundation, not
the full engine. Read `points.md` #336-356 first if `#324`'s own phase
context needs refreshing -- each entry carries real reasoning, not just
a summary of what changed. The DSL manual
(`docs/stripped-cell/UNICELL_S_DSL_MANUAL.md`) is the right starting
point for the compiler/DSL side specifically.

A genuinely long-range thread was also captured, not started
(`#351`/`#352`/`#353`, `docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/
general_purpose_programming_long_range_note.md`): real, general-purpose
programming compiled onto Unicell-S, a clarified "FPGA design side
route" (lowering the compiler's own output past ICM v3 all the way to
real, synthesizable Verilog per program), and now a third facet --
"LEGO for FPGA," a snap-in core ecosystem for third-party hardware
designers. Worth noting: this third piece isn't a new idea, it's the
direct fulfillment of a real requirement Alan already stated the day
before this session began (`#317`) -- and the RTL's own `core_select`
field already reserves the headroom for it (values 6-31, confirmed live
in `nano/icm_v3.py`'s own code). Deliberately deferred -- Alan's own
words: "sort after all this is sorted." Don't raise it again until he
does.
