# Current State (as of 2026-08-17, day 3 -- priority-list execution underway; items 1-6 done, see `points.md` #372-377 for what got added)

## Read this first

**Day 3, working the priority list in order, per Alan: "yes lets
concentratye on the list in that order ok."** Item 1 (parser error
recovery, `#372`) -- real statement-level panic-mode recovery with a
maintained brace-depth counter (a real design bug found and fixed
mid-build, traced by hand before trusting either version). Item 2
(`define` forward references, `#373`) -- a real topological sort with
cycle detection, per Alan's own suggestion to build a name table first.
Item 3 (C/Rust frontends, `#374`) -- C done (Alan's own scoping: C
first since `pycparser` was already installed, plain function-call
syntax, `place`/`field` only for pass one, cross-checked directly
against the DSL for identical output), Rust explicitly deferred. Item 4
(a real loader/binder stage, `#375`) -- built as `nano/loader_v1.py`
(manual + real first-fit auto-placement), then ACTUALLY INTEGRATED into
`workbench_v1.py`'s own `load_region()` per Alan's direct instruction
("should be callable from the workbench system"). A real transport-
layer bug found and fixed along the way (`row_offset`/`col_offset`
defaulting to `0` instead of `None`, which would have silently
defeated the whole auto-placement contract). Item 5 (manuals and
descriptions, `#376`) -- `docs/build_manual.py`'s own `SECTIONS`
rewritten against only real, current docs and ACTUALLY RUN; found and
fixed a genuine bug in the third-party `markdown` package itself (a
wrapped `#NNN`-starting line misread as a heading), a real relative-
link bug, and made a real design correction (link to `points.md`
rather than embed 300+ entries inline). `tools/explainers/
cell_pipeline_explainer.html` fully rebuilt for the current
`SUPER_LATCH` architecture -- cross-checked bit-for-bit against
`nano/icm_v3.py`'s own real encoder across 4 different cores before
being trusted. Item 6 (DSP connection, `#377`) -- checked `current/
PLAN.md`'s own "Hybrid Hard-IP Architecture" section first, found it
answers a genuinely different, mostly-obsolete question tied to the
archived Shore OS-layer system; built `find_dsp_aware_placement()` in
`nano/loader_v1.py` instead, a real, honestly-scoped first pass with
`dsp_columns`/`dsp_consuming_cores` as real caller-supplied inputs (no
real Quartus data exists yet), wired into the workbench's own
`/load_region` endpoint. 255/255 across the full new-work suite (up
from 211 at the start of this arc), zero regression on the legacy 64+6
nano scripts throughout. All pushed to `origin/main`. Next: item 7,
memory functions.

## Previous state

**`#216` final status:** items 1 (`#355`), 2/4 (`#356`/`#358`), 3
(`#361`), 5 (`#354`), 6 (`#359`) all real and done. Item 8 (the `core/`
folder name) is bookkeeping only -- `nano/` already satisfies the goal.
Per Alan's own sequencing (`#360`): **the workbench itself is next.**

## What's real and built

- **`nano/icm_v3.py`** -- `SUPER_LATCH[79:0]` encode/decode, verified
  bit-for-bit against `tb_unicell_super_v1.v`'s own real RTL test
  vectors (iverilog installed fresh this session, wasn't there
  before).
- **`nano/unicell_super_automaton_v1.py`** -- `SuperCell`/`SuperGrid`,
  dispatching across all 6 core types. nano delegated to the existing,
  already-proven `CACell` (composition, not reinvention); the other 5
  cores' behavior transcribed from their own real RTL bodies.
- **`nano/super_tile_library_v1.py`** -- Tier 0, six single-cell
  primitives with named ports, plus target tagging
  (`TARGET_UNICELL_N`/`TARGET_UNICELL_S`, `"universal"`/`"super-only"`)
  and a real second placement backend (`place_on_nano()`) proving
  "universal" is a functional guarantee, not a label.
- **`nano/composed_tile_library_v1.py`** -- Tier 1, `place_composed()`.
  Three tiles: `sentinel` (verified against the exact proven hardware
  behavior sequence), `dual_threshold_monitor` (fan-out + non-linear
  placement), `twin_sentinel` (nested composition -- a composed tile
  built from OTHER composed tiles, proven with double-namespaced
  params resolving correctly at arbitrary depth).
- **`docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/super_tile_library_scope.md`** --
  the Tier-0/Tier-1 scoping note, written before any of the above was
  built.
- **`docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/unicell_s_dsl_and_compiler_scope.md`**
  -- the DSL/compiler design proposal. Alan's own real choices so far:
  a fresh purpose-built DSL (not a Python-AST subset), diagnostics
  that are first-class (what/problem/why/suggestion, not bare
  exceptions), and a multi-pass architecture where passes collect
  every problem in one go rather than stopping at the first --
  `cell_format.py`'s own `check_pipeline_bridges()` is the real,
  already-built precedent for that shape. Nested composition
  (originally an open question in this note) is now CONFIRMED and
  PROVEN (`#342`).
- **`nano/dsl_diagnostics_v1.py`/`dsl_lexer_v1.py`/`dsl_parser_v1.py`/
  `dsl_compiler_v1.py`** -- the DSL's first real slice (`#343`). A
  `program { place ... }` grammar compiles end to end for both Tier-0
  and Tier-1 tiles (including fan-out lists and nested/namespaced
  params), with real `CompileDiagnostic`s (what/problem/why/suggestion
  + a real source span) rather than bare exceptions. RESOLVE/PLACE
  reuse `place()`/`place_composed()`'s own existing validation
  directly. "Collect every problem, don't stop at the first" confirmed
  directly for resolve/place-stage errors; lex/parse error recovery is
  the one honest, stated limitation (stops at the first syntax error).
- **`nano/program_ir_v1.py`** -- the shared, frontend-agnostic IR
  (`#344`), pulled directly out of the DSL parser's own node shapes
  (not redesigned speculatively). `dsl_compiler_v1.compile_program_ir()`
  is the real backend now; `compile_source()` is the DSL's own thin
  wrapper on top of it.
- **`nano/python_frontend_v1.py`** -- a second, real, working frontend
  proving the IR/backend split actually works, not just asserting it.
  Builds `ProgramIR` from plain Python dicts, never touches the DSL
  lexer/parser at all, and produces byte-identical output to the DSL
  frontend for the same program (`test_dsl_and_dict_frontends_agree_
  on_the_same_program`).
- **`nano/user_tile_loader_v1.py` / `nano/dsl_cli_v1.py`** -- "use this
  model" (`#345`). A real, working command-line tool: `python3
  dsl_cli_v1.py program.uc --model my_tile.json -o out.icm`. The JSON
  model format is a direct mirror of `ComposedTileSpec`, not a new
  format -- so a future composer export just needs to produce this same
  shape. `ComposedTileLibrary` gained optional parent-chaining so a
  user model shadows a same-named built-in without ever mutating the
  real registry -- tested both directions (shadowing confirmed,
  unrelated built-ins still resolve correctly alongside a loaded user
  model). Tested as a real command via `subprocess.run()`, not just
  Python internals called in-process.
- **`define`/`expose` grammar (`#346`, internals finished `#347`).** A
  program can define its own reusable composed tile inline: `define
  NAME { place ... expose ... }`, then `place` it exactly like any
  built-in tile. Fixed sub-cell params (`SubCellPlacement.fixed_params`)
  and forward declarations (two-pass: all defines first, in their own
  order, then all places) both real and tested -- a `define` still
  can't forward-reference a LATER `define`, a real, narrower, stated
  limit.
- **`nano/python_ast_frontend_v1.py`** -- a real Python-AST frontend
  (`#348`), genuinely distinct from `#344`'s dict-based proof-of-concept:
  parses actual Python syntax (`ast.parse()`, never `exec()`s it) --
  `place(...)` calls and `with define("name"): ...` blocks, every
  argument a plain literal. Cross-checked against the DSL frontend for
  the same program, byte-identical output. Every `#347` mechanism
  (define/expose/fixed-params) inherited for free, confirmed not
  assumed, since this frontend produces the same `ProgramIR` shape.
- **`docs/stripped-cell/UNICELL_S_DSL_MANUAL.md`** (`#349`, corrected
  `#350`) -- the language reference. Every code example independently
  compiled and confirmed working before inclusion. `#350` fixed a real
  framing error: "no automatic placement" was listed as a compiler
  limitation, but this project already settled that exact architectural
  boundary for the old full-cell system (`model -> ICM (shape-neutral)
  -> [BINDER] -> placement -> loader -> silicon`) -- corrected to state
  it as a genuine boundary (§9), not a gap the compiler should fill.
- **Naming hygiene lint + circular-reference guard (`#350`)** --
  `_lint_names()` (`dsl_compiler_v1.py`): real `severity: "warning"`
  diagnostics for duplicate local names, collected, shown, never
  blocking compilation. A REAL circular-reference bug found and fixed
  in `place_composed()` (`composed_tile_library_v1.py`) -- a
  hand-crafted `--model` JSON tile could self-reference or cycle
  indirectly with zero protection; confirmed as a genuine
  `RecursionError` before being fixed, not assumed. Now a clear
  `ValueError` naming the exact cycle chain.
- **The long-range note (`#351`/`#352`/`#353`)** --
  `docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/general_purpose_programming_
  long_range_note.md`. Captured, not started: real general-purpose
  programming on Unicell-S; "the FPGA design side route" clarified
  (lowering the compiler's own output past ICM v3 to real synthesizable
  Verilog, a natural backend-side extension of the already-proven "many
  frontends, one shared IR"); "LEGO for FPGA," which turned out to be
  the direct fulfillment of a real requirement Alan already stated the
  day before this session began (`#317`) -- the RTL's own `core_select`
  field already reserves the headroom for it.
- **`nano/vm_introspection_v1.py`** (`#354`) -- JSON introspection for
  the real VM, the first piece of `#216`'s own VM-core architecture,
  per Alan's own chosen sequencing (VM-core work before the workbench
  itself). Verified against actual running VM state -- the proven
  `sentinel` sequence, including its real sticky-latch behavior still
  correctly visible through the introspection layer once the
  accumulator drops back below threshold.
- **`nano/root_definition_extractor_v1.py` / `validate_icm_v3_
  against_rtl_v1.py` / `regenerate_root_definition_v1.py`** (`#355`) --
  `#216` item 1. Mechanically extracts field-map bit positions directly
  from the RTL's own comments -- confirmed genuinely tractable before
  building, not assumed. Two real parser bugs found and fixed against
  actual RTL during development (wrapped headers/descriptions silently
  losing fields), locked in as regression tests. The real payoff: an
  independent cross-check against `icm_v3.py`'s own hand-typed field
  tables (built by a human this session, transcribing the same RTL
  comments) -- PASSED, zero mismatches, genuine positive confirmation
  the earlier transcription was accurate. `nano/root_definition.json`
  is the real, re-runnable persisted artifact. Honest gap:
  `addon_config`'s own fields aren't covered (wired via module ports,
  not the same comment convention).
- **`nano/generic_field_codec_v1.py`** (`#356`) -- `#216` items 2/4,
  which turned out to be the same undertaking once scoped. Field pack/
  unpack driven entirely by `root_definition.json`, never consulting
  `icm_v3.py`'s own hand-typed tables. Proven bit-for-bit equivalent to
  `icm_v3.py`'s already-RTL-verified codec across all 6 cores and many
  values, checked systematically not assumed. Real, honest scope
  boundary: `addon_config` still isn't covered; the direction-name/list
  convenience deliberately isn't re-derived here (a separate,
  reusable-as-is concern). The actual grid/cell construction layer
  using this codec is still unstarted -- this is the field-level
  foundation only.
- **`docs/stripped-cell/SUPER_CELL_INTERNALS.md`** (`#357`, new) --
  found and fixed real doc staleness (confirmed via git log, not file
  mtimes): neither `CELL_INTERNALS.md` nor `CORES_AND_WRAPPERS_
  REFERENCE.md` covered the super carrier shell at all. Every field
  table cross-checked against the live code; every hardware figure
  checked against its own `points.md` entry (caught and fixed one own
  mistake -- a rounded timing figure). `docs/README.md`'s own index was
  also stale, missing two already-existing docs.
- **Two small wins (`#358`).** A real registry (`CoreHandler`/
  `register_core_handler()`) replaced `SuperCell`'s if/elif core
  dispatch -- proven by registering a genuinely new core type with zero
  edits to `SuperCell` itself, and confirmed zero behavior change on the
  5 real cores via the full pre-existing suite run unchanged right
  after. Root-definition-driven validation added to `SuperCell.
  from_record()`, closing a real gap: typo'd `core_config` keys were
  previously silently ignored (default zero used, no error) -- now
  caught with a clear message naming both the bad key and the correct
  one, using the same `generic_field_codec_v1.field_table()` `#356`
  already proved equivalent to `icm_v3.py`'s own.
- **`nano/vm_ai_port_v1.py`** (`#359`) -- `#216` item 6. `VMSession`:
  compile (DSL or Python-AST) -> real ICM v3 -> real running VM -> real
  JSON introspection, all through one clean object. Deliberately not
  the old `attach_ai()` precedent directly -- no ML dependency needed
  just for the port to exist; a real model attachment stays a separate,
  optional, later layer. Building and testing this end to end
  immediately found a REAL bug: `SuperGrid.run_to_quiescence()` checked
  `_pending` before ever calling `tick()` once, silently under-
  reporting quiescence for a continuously-live core with zero prior
  stimulus -- a direct violation of its own documented contract, fixed
  the same session (do-while instead of while-do), with real regression
  tests for both the broken case and the genuinely-idle case.
- **`nano/gpu_array_v1.py`** (`#361`) -- `#216` item 3, THE LAST REAL
  `#216` ITEM. `VectorizedOfferSelector` vectorizes exactly the
  cell-SELECTION phase `gpu_array.py`'s own real precedent vectorizes
  (confirmed by reading its actual kernel, not just its header -- even
  its own "Stage 1" never vectorized per-cell logic evaluation, only
  selection). Proven equivalent to `SuperGrid.tick()`'s own Pass 4
  condition, tick-by-tick, across `sentinel`/`dual_threshold_monitor`/
  `twin_sentinel`. No CUDA hardware in this sandbox (confirmed
  directly) -- CPU path real and tested, GPU path's code untested here,
  stated honestly. Fully additive: zero changes to `SuperGrid.tick()`
  itself, confirmed by the full pre-existing suite passing unchanged.

**`#216` is now closed on every real item**: 1 (`#355`), 2/4
(`#356`/`#358`), 3 (`#361`), 5 (`#354`), 6 (`#359`). Item 8 is
bookkeeping only.

- **`docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/workbench_scope.md` +
  `nano/workbench_v1.py`** (`#362`/`#363`, day 2) -- the new workbench,
  MILESTONE FINISHED. Built on a genuine line-level audit of the old
  `workbench.py`, not guessed at: confirmed which parts are dead
  (address/`gate_state`-keyed everywhere, including the embedded
  browser JS's own field bindings) vs. reusable (tick/step concept,
  `http.server` plumbing). `WorkbenchController`/`WorkbenchHandler`/
  `serve()` -- a thin HTTP layer directly over `VMSession` (`#359`),
  which already provided almost the whole replacement data layer.
  Extended with a real demo library (6 working programs, `#363`), real
  multi-program REGION management (`load_region()`/`clear_region()` on
  a shared grid, with careful `_pending` cleanup reasoned through up
  front, not found as a bug afterward), and a rewritten UI (real 2D
  grid, demo picker, region controls). Proven against a genuinely LIVE
  server twice, per Alan's own "let's see how it will work in reality":
  the original sentinel sequence via `curl`, then the full demo/region
  UX via real HTTP calls -- two independent `sentinel` regions driven
  to their proven state separately, one cleared, the other confirmed
  completely untouched. Embedded JS syntax-checked with `node --check`.
  A real sandbox constraint found and worked around (background
  processes don't survive across separate tool calls) -- the permanent
  automated test suite starts/stops the server WITHIN the same pytest
  process instead, real sockets, not mocked.

## What's NOT built yet -- open, real options

Per `#349`/`#350`'s own remaining "known limitations": parser error
recovery (one syntax error stops compilation, not a full list);
`define` can't forward-reference a LATER `define`; no multiple programs
per file (DSL or Python frontend). C/Rust frontends need an external
parser library first, not attempted. A REAL loader/binder stage for
Unicell-S is genuinely new, unscoped work now that `#350` corrected the
manual's framing -- the compiler deliberately does NOT do real hardware
placement, and nothing yet does. The actual generic grid/cell BEHAVIOR
engine (data-driven capture/offer semantics, not just field packing)
remains unstarted and may not be simply achievable -- `#358`'s own
honest scope note: that would need something much bigger (a real
hardware-behavior description language), not attempted. **The
workbench milestone is now CLOSED** -- real, honest remaining gaps for
whenever they matter, none part of the stated milestone: no
persistence (the in-memory grid/regions don't survive a server
restart); no authentication (single-user, localhost-only, matching the
old workbench's own scope); visual styling is functional, not
polished. Per Alan's own sequencing (`#360`), the real next step is
tidying the scattered 77-file root Python sprawl, deliberately timed
for after a real VM/workbench exist. The TRIX system (`mathtrix_*`/
`neurotrix_*`/`flowtrix_*`/etc., a real, sizeable, existing system with
genuine domain typing and cross-domain bridges) is a real, checked,
well-founded concern for later -- may need the compiler to learn about
DOMAINS, not just ports/fields, per `#360`'s own note. The composer
(Stage 5, `#20`) remains explicitly later work, after both compiler and
workbench.

## Also still open (carried forward, unchanged from this morning)

- `hardware/Arria10_Programming_Procedure.md` -- needs Alan's own
  judgment call (archive vs. refresh).
- The `mathtrix` root/community structural question.
- The super carrier shell's own remaining gaps (`latch_in`/
  `latch_A_dis` absent from every core; the `#323` register-count
  discrepancy; a real host/JTAG-wrapped version of the super cell).
- The RAM-side address-arbitration/retry-loop mechanism (`#301`/`#302`)
  -- needs real testing before trust.
- `sentinel_counter_v1.v`/`v2.v` still not wired into any real chain;
  `shared_bram_arbiter_v1.v` still not wired into the full tree
  system.
- The two long-queued Quartus diagnostic experiments (duplication
  flags, aggressive optimization mode).
- The 77-file root Python sprawl -- still deliberately held until the
  real VM/`core/` rebuild (now genuinely underway) is far enough along
  that archival is a real replacement, not speculative deletion.

## Next session

**The real, current, in-order priority list (`#370` + `#371`) --
items 1-6 DONE, start at item 7:**
1. ~~Parser error recovery.~~ DONE (`#372`).
2. ~~`define` forward-referencing a later `define`.~~ DONE (`#373`).
3. ~~C/Rust frontends.~~ C DONE (`#374`), Rust explicitly deferred (a
   real, separate undertaking -- `tree-sitter`/`tree-sitter-rust`
   confirmed installable, same design pattern would apply).
4. ~~A real loader/binder stage.~~ DONE (`#375`) -- `nano/loader_v1.py`,
   integrated into `workbench_v1.py`'s own `load_region()`.
5. ~~Manuals/descriptions.~~ DONE (`#376`) -- `docs/build_manual.py`'s
   own `SECTIONS` rewritten and actually run (found and fixed a real
   bug in the third-party `markdown` package along the way, plus a
   real relative-link bug and a real design correction re: embedding
   `points.md`). `tools/explainers/cell_pipeline_explainer.html`
   rebuilt for the current `SUPER_LATCH` chain -- cross-checked
   bit-for-bit against `nano/icm_v3.py`'s own real encoder across 4
   cores before being trusted.
6. ~~DSP connection.~~ DONE (`#377`) -- checked `current/PLAN.md`'s own
   "Hybrid Hard-IP Architecture" section first, found it answers a
   genuinely different, mostly-obsolete question tied to the archived
   Shore OS-layer system (soft-fabric-to-DSP arithmetic offload, not
   placement/locality). Built `find_dsp_aware_placement()` in
   `nano/loader_v1.py` instead -- a real, honestly-scoped first pass
   (biases placement toward given DSP columns for DSP-consuming cores,
   treats the shape as one rigid unit rather than the full anchor-
   first BFS design still on record for later). Both `dsp_columns` and
   `dsp_consuming_cores` are real caller-supplied inputs, not hardcoded
   assumptions -- no real Quartus post-fit data exists yet. Wired into
   the workbench's own `/load_region` endpoint, matching item 4's own
   "build standalone, then integrate" precedent.
7. **Memory functions -- START HERE.** The RAM-side address-
   arbitration retry loop (`#301`/`#302`) and sentinel/`bram_arbiter`
   wiring, both still unresolved.
8. The Composer (`#20`, Stage 5) -- reintroduced per Alan's own direct
   call in `#371` (reversing `#370`'s earlier "real doubt" framing),
   explicitly positioned LAST, after everything above -- its own real
   premise ("pre made models and full understanding of the system")
   is why DSP/memory logically come first.

**Real future core candidates saved, not integrated (`#378`):** a
multiplier, divider, and subtractor from Alan, saved to `docs/
stripped-cell/design-notes/future-core-candidates/` for whenever "LEGO
for FPGA" (`#353`) gets picked up -- `core_select` 6-31 is real,
reserved headroom for exactly this. One real bug found and verified in
the divider (a Verilog syntax error, confirmed with `iverilog`, saved
unmodified with the fix documented in the folder's own README, not
silently patched). A real timing concern recorded up front: the
divider's own 32-stage unrolled combinational critical path would
likely violate the real, hard per-hop timing this architecture depends
on -- worth remembering before wrapping it as a real core, not
discovering it after the fact.

**A real DSP-chain-vs-BRAM design note (`#379`/`#380`), IMPORTANT
context for item 7 (memory functions) specifically:** `docs/stripped-
cell/design-notes/dsp_chain_vs_bram_connectivity.md` -- Arria 10 DSP
blocks have a real, hardwired, column-local `chainin`/`chainout`
cascade bus (64-bit, confirmed via real Intel documentation); chain
position is fixed at Quartus place-and-route time, so it's a
PLACEMENT concern (matching `loader_v1.py`'s own role), not a runtime
protocol field. M20K/BRAM connects through NORMAL fabric interconnect
instead -- no dedicated cascade bus at all, confirmed with the same
rigor. **Read this note before starting item 7** -- memory connection
is a genuinely different kind of problem from DSP connection (`#377`),
not the same placement concept applied twice. Also confirmed the
actual archived MathTrix/MIF precedent (extracted from `old_trix_
domain_family.onion`, not recalled from memory) -- a real asymmetric
control/mantissa split by function, not an even bit-count split,
though the underlying principle does support Alan's own proposed even
32/32 split for the DSP case specifically, since a flat accumulator
has no natural asymmetric boundary the way a float does. **A real
architectural conclusion added on top (`#380`):** DSP needs its own
specialist wrapper CORE TYPE (not a mode on any existing core,
`core_select` 6-31 headroom); the 64-bit chain resolves into TWO
PARALLEL 32-bit-wide chains, each using the fabric's own already-real
32-bit value convention. Independently converges on the exact same
structural shape MIF already uses -- a genuine, useful cross-check
worth remembering: "N standard-width cells, not one wide cell" is
probably the right general answer for wide hard-IP interfaces here,
not a DSP-specific one-off. Still real, open, unresolved: how the two
32-bit lanes stay correctly paired as they propagate, and whether
high/low are the same core type with a role field or two distinct
types.

**Confirmed NOT wanted, don't build these:** multiple programs per ICM
file, the `core/` folder rename.

**Explicitly deferred, with a real stated reason each:** hardware-
target work ("too many variables" right now); "LEGO for FPGA" ("maybe
when we get there").

**Explicitly OUT of scope, a real future enabler not a task (`#371`):**
integrating the command-cell wrapper (`cell_command_v1.v` --
docs/stripped-cell/CELL_INTERNALS.md's own "Companion modules" section)
into Unicell-S. It's not exposed anywhere in the shell's own reduced
nano subset today. Alan's own words: "not part of the scope directly,
but if it were it would open some more possibilities later" -- recorded
so the reasoning isn't lost, not because it's queued.

**Already done earlier this session (`#370`):** the pytest `sys.exit(0)`
crash is genuinely FIXED (`norecursedirs` in `pyproject.toml`), not
just re-flagged -- confirmed a bare `pytest --collect-only` no longer
crashes. A real, separate, pre-existing issue surfaced while checking:
`tests/fpga/` fails to import `pyserial` -- confirmed NOT a regression
(same error count as before, previously masked by the crash), a real,
still-open item, not chased further given limited usage.

**Real conclusions from Alan worth remembering, not just "still
open":** TRIX -- "would not be viable on this model at all," a real,
definitive conclusion, stronger than `#360`'s earlier "checked concern
for later." Treat as closed. Loops/general-purpose memory -- still a
genuinely open question, but Alan gave a real, sharp reason the scope
is likely to stay limited: branching on this substrate means every
branch outcome needs its own physical cells existing simultaneously
(spatial MUX), so branch-heavy control flow doesn't scale the way it
does on a substrate with a real program counter. `hardware/
Arria10_Programming_Procedure.md` still needs Alan's own human call
(archive vs. refresh), per `#333`'s own earlier note.

Read `points.md` #336-371 first if `#324`'s own phase context needs
refreshing -- each entry carries real reasoning, not just a summary of
what changed. The DSL manual
(`docs/stripped-cell/UNICELL_S_DSL_MANUAL.md`) is the right starting
point for the compiler/DSL side; `docs/stripped-cell/
SUPER_CELL_INTERNALS.md` is the right starting point for the shell/RTL
side; `nano/vm_ai_port_v1.py`'s `VMSession` (or the workbench itself,
`python3 nano/workbench_v1.py`) is the easiest way to try something out
end to end without wiring the compiler/VM/introspection together by
hand.

A genuinely long-range thread was also captured, not started
(`#351`/`#352`/`#353`, `docs/stripped-cell/design-notes/
general_purpose_programming_long_range_note.md`): real, general-purpose
programming compiled onto Unicell-S, a clarified "FPGA design side
route" (lowering the compiler's own output past ICM v3 all the way to
real, synthesizable Verilog per program), and now a third facet --
"LEGO for FPGA," a snap-in core ecosystem for third-party hardware
designers. Worth noting: this third piece isn't a new idea, it's the
direct fulfillment of a real requirement Alan already stated the day

in `nano/icm_v3.py`'s own code). Deliberately deferred -- Alan's own
words: "sort after all this is sorted." Don't raise it again until he
does.
